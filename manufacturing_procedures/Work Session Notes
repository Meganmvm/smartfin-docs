Project overview with Nathan
Discussed the planned procedures for mold process
Put procedures and questions in readme.

1/23/24
Filed down edges of mold to produce chamfer
Disposed of shavings in the Hazardous Lab Waste bucket
Reviewed Senior Design Report from previous mold design

1/30/24 - First Resin Cast!
Cleaned all mold pieces thoroughly with soap and water
Taped over electronics holes
Hand brushed on a coat of PVA
Screwed pieces together
Mixed resin under fume hood, approximately 12 pumps of epoxy part 1
- Need to purchase measuring device for resin in the future
- Need to create resin well insert for mold
Laid down cardboard in pressure pot and inserted full mold
Set pressure pot to 30 PSI at 4:00 pm
Total work time: 1 hour 30 minutes

1/31/24
-Pressure pot completely depressurized overnight, possible that a valve was not fully closed
Removed from pressure pot at 12:00 pm
Total curing time: 20 hours
No significant leakage from mold 
-Filling fully to top of mold resulted in air pockets at top of fin box, will need resin pool
-One air pocket present at tip of fin, possibly need to vibrate the mold after filling the tip with resin
M10 screws easily separted mold halves
Fin is sticky to the touch, stuck to bottom mold half
Fin was able to be removed fully intact by prying around edges, starting at tip and moving towards box
-Fin box geometry is fully formed
-Taping over electronics port holes resulted in the tape sticking to the fin
Washing the fin with soap and water significantly reduced stickiness
