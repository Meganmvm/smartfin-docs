# Smartfin v3 Manufacturing Procedures
## Equipment
Plastic tool for clearing air relief channels

## Supplies
- PVA
- Resin
- Slow Hardener

## Procedure
### Preparing the Mold
Ensure that the mold is clean by rinsing all contact surfaces with water and drying with a microfiber towel

* Use wax to cover the pin holes in the mold. Scrape down to be flush with the mold.

Using a brush, or spray tool if not available, to apply a coating of PVA to all contact surfaces

* Inlay fiberglass and electronics here

Lay the "top" piece of the mold onto the "bottom" piece and check proper alignment 

Use bolts to secure the top piece to the bottom piece, switching between bolts frequently to ensure an even application

* Include washers for these bolts?

Rotate the mold so that the resin inlets are facing upwards

Prepare the resin
- 252 mL resin, 42 ml hardener
- Mix until consistent, then use vacuum pot to remove air bubbles

Fill resin to top of inlets
- Add a small amount (~50mL), then tilt the mold side to side to ensure there are no air pockets in the tip of the fin before pouring the remaining resin.
* Vibrate mold to release large air pockets?

Transfer to Pressure Vessel

### Using the Pressure Vessel
Line the bottom of the pressure vessel with cardboard or another expendable material to account for any leaking from the mold

Place the mold in the vessel so that the resin inlets are facing upwards

* Add additional resin bay to account for air pocket release?

Check that the pressure vessel gasket is intact and clear of debris

Check that the edge of the pressure vessel is intact and clear of debris

Begin tightening down the lid of the pressure vessel, hand tightening screws on opposing sides at the same time

Once light resistance is met, begin to tighten each screw one quarter turn each, moving in a diamond pattern across the screws

Stop tightening once all four screws cannot be hand tightened

Ensure that the inlet regulator is closed and locked, and that the inlet valve and bleed valves are closed

Attach air hose to the pressure vessel inlet and slowly open the air hose valve

Slowly open the inlet valve, and then turn the regulator to begin pressurizing the vessel to 60 psi

Once desired pressure is reached, close the regulator fully and lock it

Close the inlet valve, then the air hose valve, and then slowly open the bleed valves to remove excess pressure from the air hose

Detach the air hose from the pressure vessel

### Post-Processing
* How many hours minimum for resin to cure?

Slowly open the pressure outlet valve

* Cover with rag or buy dampener?

Begin to release each screw one quarter turn each, moving in a diamond pattern across the screws, until resistance is negligable

Fully detach lid screws, then remove the lid

Pull the mold and expendable material from the vessel

* Acetone to clean the vessel?

Lay the mold on a surface with the bottom piece down

Remove bolts securing the top piece to the bottom piece, switching between bolts frequently

Screw bolts into the threaded holes of the top piece to slowly pry the top piece from the bottom piece, switching between bolts frequently

Remove the top piece of the mold from the bottom piece, applying only a light amount of force if necessary

Inspect the quality of the fin

On the fin, file down any remnants of the mold

Use a plastic tool to remove any resin remaining in the relief channels

Clean the entire surface of the mold using water
