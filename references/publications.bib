  abstract = {It is challenging for scientists to collect oceanographic data in nearshore environments because the high amount of wave energy present in these areas makes it difficult to deploy autonomous sensors. To address this issue, scientists at Scripps Institute of Oceanography have developed the Smartfin--a surfboard fin with wireless embedded sensors--since the surf zone encompasses the same coastal regions that these scientists are interested in studying. However, collecting oceanic data with the Smartfin poses new problems, as surfer movement may now potentially bias the information being collected. Therefore, this research explores the use of robust machine learning algorithms to determine how a surfer is moving on his or her board. This research is based on surf sessions recorded around the University of California San Diegoâ€™s campus, and includes the following locations: La Jolla Shores (La Jolla, CA), Scripps Pier (La Jolla, CA), and K-38 (Baja California, Mexico). The machine learning models experimented with in this thesis include: logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machines with linear and non-linear kernels. Through the use of feature engineering on a dataset taken from a single surf session, we were able to predict the following classes: floating, paddling, and surfing with 86% accuracy. However, our mean classification accuracy drops to 70% when training and testing subsets are taken from the combined dataset of all surf sessions, where oceanic conditions within the dataset become more variable. Future work will need to be done to determine whether this level of classification accuracy is adequate for oceanographers who are using the Smartfin to collect data for scientific purposes.},
